Notes: 
- Please remember that node_modules need to be installed before running any of the projects.
- Some of the sites hosted using firebase have bugs that are not in the source code, for example the personal site one of the buttons on the navbar doesn't work.
- Projects that need to many things to work have images or gifs of the actual Project if you don't feel like doing everything necesary to view them.
- Travel Tracker, List Project and World Captial Quiz use my databases in order to function, so keep that in mind.
